    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-person"  style="color: #FFC800D5"></i>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and driven full-stack developer, software engineer, 
        and digital marketing specialist with a strong foundation in Computer Science. 
        My expertise spans across multiple domains, including web development, 
        data-driven solutions, and creating dynamic, user-friendly applications. 
        Currently pursuing a Computer Science major, I continuously challenge myself 
        to enhance my skills and take on new projects.
        I have a diverse range of experiences, from working as a Front Desk/Activity 
        Attendant for SEMO Recreational Services to tutoring students in Computer 
        Science and Mathematics. Through these roles, Iâ€™ve developed excellent 
        communication, problem-solving, and leadership skills, allowing me to thrive 
        in both technical and collaborative environments.
        
        I'm also actively co-founding a company that will offer software development 
        services on a contract basis, combining my strong technical foundation with an 
        entrepreneurial mindset. I love building innovative tools, such as LazyProf, 
        an auto-grading platform recognized by my university's Computer Science department 
        for improving grading efficiency. My portfolio showcases a blend of creativity 
        and technical expertise, with a commitment to providing impactful, data-driven results.
        
        In my free time, I enjoy learning new frameworks, exploring full-stack projects, 
        and contributing to open-source communities. With a strong desire to continuously 
        improve and educate others, I'm always looking for opportunities to apply my skills 
        in meaningful and challenging ways.
